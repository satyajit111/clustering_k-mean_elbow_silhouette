## Text Clustering for Enhanced Recommendation Systems

This repository showcases the implementation of a clustering-based recommendation model. The provided scripts leverage the K-Means algorithm to enhance the recommendation system's accuracy and efficiency.

### Motivation

The primary motivation behind writing this code was to improve the recommendation model's performance by grouping similar items together. Clustering allows for a more nuanced understanding of the data, which in turn enables the recommendation system to suggest items that are more closely aligned with the user's preferences.

### Input Data

The scripts are designed to process text data from a CSV file, specifically focusing on product names. This data serves as the foundation for clustering, where each product name is treated as an individual data point.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The scripts include preprocessing steps to handle missing values and prepare the data for vectorization.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts text data into numerical values, emphasizing the importance of unique words across the dataset.
- **Optimal Cluster Determination**: Employs both the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores to determine the most appropriate number of clusters for the data.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups the vectorized text data into clusters, which are then used to power the recommendation system.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the similarity between items within clusters to ensure that the recommendations are relevant.

### Practical Application

By clustering products based on their names, the recommendation system can identify patterns and similarities that may not be immediately apparent. This clustering approach is particularly useful for large datasets where manual categorization is impractical. The end result is a recommendation system that is both scalable and adept at handling a diverse range of products.

This description provides an overview of the scripts' purpose, the motivation for their creation, and the practical applications of the clustering in the context of a recommendation system. Feel free to modify this description to better suit your project or add any additional details you deem necessary.


Certainly! Here's a comprehensive description for your GitHub repository that outlines the functionality and purpose of the two clustering scripts:

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to group text data. The scripts utilize the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method for vectorizing text data, which transforms the text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### Script 1: Optimal Cluster Identification and Visualization

The first script (`find_optimal_clusters`) is designed to help identify the optimal number of clusters for K-Means clustering. It includes the following features:
- **Elbow Method Visualization**: Plots the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) for a range of cluster numbers to help identify the elbow point, which suggests the optimal number of clusters.
- **Silhouette Score Analysis**: Computes and plots the silhouette scores for different numbers of clusters to assess the quality of the clustering.
- **Cosine Similarity Check**: Evaluates the similarity of items within clusters to ensure that related texts are grouped together.

This script is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis when the number of clusters is not known a priori.

### Script 2: Text Clustering Implementation

The second script (`text_to_cluster`) provides a straightforward implementation of text clustering with a predefined number of clusters. It includes:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts a collection of raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups the text data into the specified number of clusters.
- **Cluster Centroids and Labels**: Outputs the cluster centroids and labels for each text entry.

This script is ideal for users who have already determined the optimal number of clusters and wish to apply the K-Means algorithm to their text data.

### Usage

Both scripts are designed to work with a CSV file containing text data. Users can specify the path to their CSV file, and the scripts will handle the preprocessing, vectorization, and clustering of the text data. The results can be used for various applications such as document categorization, topic modeling, or information retrieval.
