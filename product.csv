Micellar Water 3 in 1 Refreshing,"[{""reviewer_name"":""NYgal"",""review"":""TL;DR: Does what it promises; gently cleans thoroughly without harsh rubbing or harsh surfactants while nourishing & hydrating the skin.\nYou DO need to rinse it off though. The RoseWater & Waterproof ones are the best in the lineup. I’ve finished my second bottle and will be rebuying.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHAS MANY ADVANTAGES & VERY FEW DRAWBACKS\n\nPros:\n•Works\n•Gentle\n•Soothing\n•Affordable\n•No Sulfates\n•No Alcohols\n•No Fragrance\n•Non-Stripping\n•Non-Sensitizing\n•Non-Comedogenic\n•Subtle aroma/scent\n•Nourishing ingredients\n•Doesn’t aggravate acne\n•Doesn’t exacerbate acne\n•Doesn’t irritate my eyes\n•Doesn’t leave much residue\n•Suitable for very sensitive skin\n•Suitable for dry & balanced skin\n•Suitable for oily-dehydrated skin\n•Dissolves oilbased cosmetics well\n•Dissolves waterbased cosmetics well\n•Removes any filth on the skin’s surface\n•Removes any excess sebum on the skin’s surface\n\nCons:\n•Adds less hydration than advertised\n•Removing heavy mineral sunscreens takes effort\n•Waterproof/waterresistant cosmetics takes effort\n•It removes thin ointment like neosporin but it doesn’t fully remove thick ointments, such as, vaseline, aquaphor & cerave healing ointment.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDOES WHAT IT PROMISES\n\nCompared to the other micellar waters I’ve tried, it does seem to replace some of the hydration you lose from cleansing off your sebum & sweat\n\nAt the end of a day my skin will have some filth, sebum, eyeliner, eyebrow powder, mascara, tinted hybrid sunscreen & pore blurring primer on it.\nIt’s mild unlike harsh makeup wipes that tug at your skin & have tons of preservatives. All I need to do is soak both sides of a thick (“premium”) cotton pad with the solution and wipe with each side to get my face & neck clean. Then I’m ready to rinse with cool water and follow up with either a face wash or a wet microfiber makeup remover cloth (all micellar waters have surfactants that should be washed off the face)\n\nThe first step of my nightly skincare routine. After I finish cleaning I wipe my face with Stridex (toner) pads. The pad is always free of residue so I’m certain that this is cleaning effectively!\n\nNote: The Rose water version will probably only be 4/5 stars for people who prefer to regularly wear very heavy makeup, waterproof makeup or water-resistant mineral sunscreens. Try Garnier’s waterproof version or one of Bioderma’s micellar water.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGOOD FOR VARIOUS SKIN TYPES\n\nMy skin type is combination\nLips & Chin = Dry\nT-Zone & next to the nose = Oily\nRest of the face = Balanced/Normal\n\nso I needed a makeup remover/pre-cleanser that’s compatible  with my entire face and this fits the bill!\nIt sufficiently cleanses my oily areas without stripping the balanced areas and it keeps my dry areas hydrated\n\nI mainly use this on my face & neck and it’s works just as well on both areas.\nMy face is acneic and normal-resilient. My neck is acne-free and normal-sensitive.\n\nI felt the need to test the acidity of this product before saying it won’t sensitize your skin because many people experience irritation or barrier damage from regularly using cleansers & toners. The healthiest skin has a pH no higher than 5.0. It appears this Micellar Rose Water has a pH right between 4.5 & 5.0 (see picture) so you don’t have to worry about it altering your skin’s healthy acidity level.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA GREAT ADDITION TO THE LINE UP\n\nI’ve tried the “All-in-1 Waterproof” version (Clear bottle, Blue Cap) & it’s the best if you want a deep clean very quickly. IIRC it leaves a bit more product residue, lacks skin nourishing additives & doesn’t hydrate; so it’s not the best choice for everyone.\n\nThe “All-in-1 Mattifying” version (Clear Bottle, Green Cap) I can’t recommend. Acne prone individuals may gravitate towards it because it reduces shine, oil & bacteria temporarily but; none of the ingredients “purify pores” and using tons of denatured alcohol on your face daily is not great for your lipid barrier. People with super oily skin should probably buy one of the other micellar waters and use it as their first cleanser then wash off the residue with a foaming cleanser, benzoyl peroxide cleanser or a salicylic acid cleanser.\n\nThe “All-in-1 Brightening” version (Translucent Yellow Bottle, Yellow Cap) is okay but vitamin c needs to be on your skin for at least 30 minutes before being washed off to brighten skin or lighten pigment and you’re absolutely not supposed to regularly leave micellar water on your face for more than a couple minutes.\n\nThe “All-in-1 Sensitive” version (Clear Bottle, Pink Cap) is the most similar to this one in my experience. I would recommend it for people with sensitive skin that isn’t prone to roughness nor dehydration.\n\nThe nourishing ingredients added to this Rose water version of the product makes it a stand out!\n\nPropanediol is a good humectant & emollient making it good for dehydrated skin conditions. It also boosts the effectiveness of things like salicylic acid.\nGlycerin is also an amazing humectant.\nRosa damascena flower water may have skin conditioning, antimicrobial, antioxidant & anti-inflammatory benefits making it great for both dry & acneic skin.\nCaprylyl/Capryl Glucoside is a good cleansing surfactant for keeping your skin clean but it’s very mild compared to others making it good for sensitized skin.\nSalicylic acid slows how quickly acne bacteria reproduces & purifies the pores.\n\nThe Garnier SkinActive micellar water line up needed this product.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""NYgal"",""review"":""I bought this to remove my makeup before washing my face.

Youth Code Skin Illuminator Tinted All-in-1 Moisturizer SPF 20,"[{""reviewer_name"":""Claudia"",""review"":""I have olive skin that doesn't really wrinkle even though I""m almost 50, but I've always dark circles under my eyes. The shade of my skin is light to medium, but I really intentionally wanted to get fair as I wanted this as a highlighter and something that would distract from my dark circles and lighten up my face.  Few things really seem to cover the dark circles.  This stuff however is the most amazing stuff I've ever tried for my under eye circles; it doesn't so much ""cover"" them as replaces them with light, but the end result is they are not visible.  Rather than try to fill in the whole under-eye area, I dab this stuff on in the deepest hollow of the eye and tap it on with my finger. I don't rub it in but allow it to soak in, and if necessary remove any excess.  I also use this amazing stuff right under my eyebrows and right on top of my cheeks where the top of the cheekbone is.  It lights up my face and makes it look luminous.  I think the trick to this product is that you don't use it as a concealer and don't apply it heavily.  I have tried all sorts of expensive concealers but this light reflector looks better than anything I've ever tried. I also tried it on a friend who is much younger and does not have olive skin but rather caucasian pinkish skin. In her case, I put it under her eyes (she does have hollows even though in her 20s), and also under the brow and on top of the cheekbone.

And no there was not any white or sticky residue and it was very easy to wash off. I'm still wondering  why some reviews were negative. Its a nice product & yes, it is worth the money."",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Sweet T"",""review"":""I'm pretty new to face masks - I'm just starting my routine and it usually involves a sheet mask that probably does more through the placebo effect than anything else. I wanted to give a real product a try so I did some research and read a lot of reviews and I ended up ordering this. I noticed a difference immediately after the first use, and my skin feels amazing every time I use it. (EDIT: added pics. I've been using this mask about once a week for a few months and these are immediate before/after for my last use. You can notice a smoother texture/complexion as well as cleaner pores. This was after an exfoliating face wash.)\n\nRating:\nI'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars mostly because the size of the product is so small. Being new to this stuff, I'm not sure if this kind of size is standard as I could not find a larger version. The rating is also 4/5 because after the first 2 or so uses I haven't seen any other skin improvements. Immediately after every use I can see a change, but no long-term improvements use after use. In other words, I do really like this product and I will probably buy it again, but it was not amazing.\n\nFeel:\nThis face mask doesn't really exfoliate at all. It's supposed to exfoliate as you wash it off but the bits of rock are so few that it doesn't do much. I use an exfoliating face wash instead and then put this on afterward. I have fairly sensitive and very dry skin, so the mask does tingle a bit but it never gets uncomfortable. Once I wash it off my face does feel fantastic - hydrated, plump, and extremely smooth and clean. I do put some light moisturizer on after as my skin is so dry.\n\nResults:\nThe first 2 times I used it I noticed an immediate difference that stayed through the next day. Since then it's stayed about the same - it has shrinked and lessened my visible pores as well as clearing out the big ones on my nose. It has also made my skin tone and texture more even throughout, smoothing the overall appearance. However, even with repeated use (about once a week) it has not cleared out those large pores as much as I would've hoped. Considering how much it did the first couple times I expected it to clear them out much more after a few more uses.\n\nMy boyfriend tried this mask with me once and he was super into it. He almost never washes his face unless I remind him, and after using this he couldn't stop touching his face for hours. He was amazed at how clear and smooth it was. He's Asian American and has what he calls ""Asian grease"" - basically he has fairly oily skin.

I like the navy blue color because black is to harsh especially when your older.. This softens the look I use it as an eyeliner using water dipped thin slanted brush.. Try it !"",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Sierra"",""review"":""i found this product at the cvs drug store in my hometown, however, it was priced at $10-12, which i believe is a bit high for a ""non-name brand"" or non department store eye shadow, however these are just the prices of living in southren california alone the coast i assume. On amazon, i found it for much less, i think i paid $5-6 with shipping included. When i recieved this product, there was some plastic covering or something inside of it that i did NOT previously find in the one i opened (probably against the stores rules) in the store. I was a little suspicious of this, it was a gray piece of plastic that had a small piece in the middle that stuck straight up, so that someone could easily pull it upward and out of the jar, after i did this, i found the black eye shadow underneath it. I don't know if others experienced this or not??... I think it could have been a mistake from the packaging department, they could have accidentally not taken this plastic piece out of the makeup jar, or it could have just been used to take up space in the jar. Either way, it looked like it was used to press the powder into the jar tightly and it pressed it to form the shape of the jar. I felt a little cheated out of my makeup, like maybe it was now half the amount that was originally supposed to be in the jar, however i could not complain because it was half the price as well. So i assumed it was a mistake and kept inspecting my new product. i looked on the outside and it seemed like the same exact jar and size, however, it seemed like there were less sparkles in the black color that i received than the color that i originally saw at the store.Then i decided to take the color and try it on my hand. i took my finger and pressed it into the shadow and swiped it across the top of my hand, like most of us girls do when we want to see what a product will look like once used on the skin, this again looked like it had maybe not less glitter, because there was actually a lot of glitter, but the eye shadow did look less pigmented, or like it was gray, and had to be applied in multiple layers to achieve the black black look to it, and the sparkles seemed to be all silvery, not like the rainbow sparkles i had seen at the store. i am planning on going into the store again, maybe purchasing it there to see if they are the same, or taking the one i now have into the store to compare them., it could just be me, or the lighting of the store versus my house, that threw me off. whatever the case, i am being extremely harsh and critical. because i was only purchasing this color due to the specific sparkle it  had to it in the store, i have plenty of black eye shadow, and i do not need another one. So that is why i am being so judgmental about the specific color. Also, i found it weird for there to be a big piece of plastic pressed up against the powder in the jar that is not visible from the outside. And that plastic piece was not in any of the other ones i had open at the store. Other than those two minor details, this product was great. i loved the color and how it went on, it was extremely sparkly and glittery, it was highly pigmented if u used a lot or put multiple layers, it was almost gel or cream-like, but not. so that made it easy to apply, and it did not crease or flake onto the lower under eye or cheek bones. I showed my mom this product and she was like ""oww, wow that is a beautiful color, look at all those sparkles, i wanna try that!!' So  yes this color is great, the application is great, however i must deduct one star due to the weird plastic thing being in there, and not in the others, and due to my previous viewing of it . when i put it on my hand before, or ""tried it on my skin"" in the store (which i was again not supposed to do... oops.. but how else am i gonna be able to tell, there are no testers?) it went on much easier with a higher amount of pigment, a stronger and darker swipe of black went on easier, and the sparkles were a rainbow/variety of colors, not just all silver sparkles.Either way it is still a pretty color, and i like the consistency of the product itself. It is easy to put on without having to use a lot of the product over and over, maybe 2-3 layers would achieve the color in the jar, and sometimes this is good, so that a lighter color can be applied when blending the color into other colors. I just wanted black with an array of different colored sparkles in it, when in actuality it is a black with silver sparkles, so many that it gives it a metallic gun-metal gray look to the color when it is applied."",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""S.

Smooth Sugar Clear Scrub,"[{""reviewer_name"":""Wildflower"",""review"":""I bought the duo (scalp scrub + dandruff shampoo) and let me start by saying that the jasmine scent is DIVINE. I'm not one of those people who has a super strong or easily offended sense of smell (pleasant fragrances don't bother me much even when they are quite powerful), so perhaps this would be too intense for someone who is more sensitive to fragrance, but holy moly this stuff smells aaaahhhhmazing! It's honestly the best smelling shampoo I've ever bought!\n\nWith that being said, although I like the shampoo, but I bought this set specifically for the scalp scrub which I didn't find effective. Again, it smells fantastic (same scent as the shampoo), but the scrubby ground apricot particles just aren't plentiful enough to do anything. Plus, I have long hair, and although it's fine, it was damn near impossible to get this stuff down into my scalp enough to exfoliate at all -- and my hair isn't even that thick. So if you have short hair this might work great, but if it's long (especially thick and long) I'd advise that the scrub probably won't do much for you. You might be better off creating your own scrub via an online DIY recipe using sugar or something of that nature.\n\nAlso, if your main priority is exfoliation and scalp stimulation, I'd HIGHLY recommend getting a cheap scalp scrubber shampoo brush (the little round kind with a finger grip and flexible silicone spikes).\n\nI personally bought this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B086SC9NH3?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title\n\nIt was only $2.39 with free Prime shipping and it works great. Really gets down into your roots and scrubs the scalp very nicely, but without being harsh or painful. Gives you the tingles and leaves your scalp feeling super clean. Feels wonderful!\n\nAs for the dandruff shampoo... I don't actually have dandruff (as I mentioned, I bought this duo specifically just for the scalp scrub), but I'm pleasantly surprised by the shampoo. It's creamy, lathers luxuriously, smells freaking AMAZING, cleans nicely, and feels soothing, so I have no complaints. I can't attest to whether or not it stops dandruff, but it contains the proper active ingredient and feels soothing and refreshing, so I have no reason to think it wouldn't.\n\nAll-in-all these are nice products, smell fantastic, and clean nicely, but I just don't find the scrub effective at all. However the shampoo is great, so I'm still giving this purchase 5 stars. 👍"",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Amy Zhao"",""review"":""I have medium-level dandruff that builds up and makes my scalp feel disgusting if I don't use this hair scrub. Using a regular shampoo and conditioner didn't do anything for my dandruff, and it would reappear when my hair dried, with my scalp still feeling pretty bad. I tried this product after a Loreal salesperson handed me a sample at a UCLA event, and from the very first time I tried it, I knew that it worked perfect for me. I've bought this continuously for two years, and I'm only getting around to writing a review now. So, pro: this stuff works!\nThe scent when you scoop some of this stuff out is pretty strong, and I don't doubt it might be unpleasant for some people while rubbing it into their hair. However, I've never really minded the scent, and once you wash it out, it only leaves a faint trace that's way more pleasant. I've gotten compliments on how my hair smelled after using this scrub.  Furthermore, when you wash it out, it de-tangles your hair, so it's like a pseudo-conditioner! However, I still recommend using a conditioner because I tried only using the hair scrub and it made my hair really frizzy.\nThe hair scrub gets rid of most of my dandruff, but to get the rest of it, I also use the everfresh antidandruff shampoo and conditioner of the same line.  So, to be clear, I do hair scrub -> shampoo -> conditioner, and not the hair scrub last. I only use the shampoo on my scalp, and then the conditioner on the rest of my hair and the ends, and I end up with a clean-feeling scalp and incredibly soft and not frizzy hair. I think Loreal really hit it out the park with these products. My only complaint is that I go through the hair scrub pretty fast, but I might be using too much of it each time I shower. Since I have long hair, I have to take big scoops and then spread them out and rub it in slow circles to really cover my whole scalp.

This product has quickly become an essential part of my skincare routine.\n\nFirst and foremost, the fragrance-free formula is a game-changer for me. It's gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn't cause any irritation. This is a huge plus, as I've had trouble with scented products in the past.\n\nThe texture of this face cream is just perfect - it's creamy, yet light, and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves my face feeling hydrated without any greasiness. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin since I started using this moisturizer. It feels smoother and looks more radiant.\n\nOne of the main reasons I chose this product was for its collagen-boosting properties. As I've gotten older, I've started to notice fine lines and wrinkles appearing. After consistent use, I can confidently say that this moisturizer has made a noticeable difference in reducing the appearance of those wrinkles. My skin looks plumper and more youthful.\n\nI also appreciate that it comes in a generous 1.7 oz size, so it lasts a long time. A little goes a long way, so I feel like I'm getting great value for my money.\n\nOverall, L’Oréal Paris Collagen Daily Face Moisturizer has exceeded my expectations. It's a fantastic addition to my skincare routine and has become a staple product in my collection.
